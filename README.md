## React-Canvas

This module is intended to be a library that allows an HTML5 &lt;canvas&gt; element to exist seamlessly with a React application, using React-like components to allow drawing onto the canvas using JSX.

## Installation

With NPM

    npm install --save @bucky24/react-canvas

With Yarn

    yarn add @bucky24/react-canvas

ReactCanvas has a peer dependency on `react`. It requires version 18 at minimum.

## Usage

The module exports a series of components that can be used in JSX. To use, declare a canvas of specific width and height inside your React app, then use the same nesting syntax as the rest of React to draw various elements. The components register and behave (with some exceptions) as normal React components, so most standard behaviors with components should work for them.

#### Warning

These modules **must** be inside a Canvas object to work properly, and normal HTML tags cannot be used inside them. So you can't nest ReactCanvas tags, then HTML tags, then more ReactCanvas tags.

## Available Elements

### Canvas

The root level element. This will actually create a &lt;canvas&gt; canvas tag on the page. However, it will also pass the 2D context object into React context of all its children. This allows the children to draw to the canvas object.

#### Parameters

| Parameter    | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| width  | The width, in pixels, of the resulting canvas  |
| height   | The height, in pixels, of the resulting canvas  |
| captureAllKeyEvents | If this is set to false, any events not originating from the body (which is the default when no input field is selected) will be ignored. If this is set to true (default), all key events will be captured. You should set this to false if you have any dom elements outside of the canvas that need to handle key events.
| enable3d | If true, the canvas is configured as a webgl canvas, with a webgl context. Not all components will work in this mode. Default false. |
| drawWidth | The width, in pixels, that the canvas should use when drawing. Defaults to `width` |
| drawHeight | The height, in pixels, that the canvas should use when drawing. Defaults to `height` |

##### Children

Accepts multiple children. Children should be valid ReactCanvas elements.

##### Example

```
return (<div>
	<Canvas
		width={300}
		height={300}
	>
	    {reactCanvasElements}
	</Canvas>
</div>);
```

### Shape

The Shape element is simple-it draws a shape centered around a given point. Note that there have to be at least 3 entries in the `points` array

##### Parameters

| Parameter    | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| x  | The origin x coord of the shape |
| y   | The origin y coord of the shape  |
| points | An array containing objects with x and y parameters. This will form the body of the shape. Note that all coords in this array are relative to the x and y given as top level params. |
| color | A hex color code, which determines the color of the shape |
| fill | a boolean value, which determines if the shape is drawn as an outline (false) or a filled in shape (true) |
| close | A boolean value (default true) which determines if the shape's path is closed before drawing, or left empty. Closing the path means a line will be drawn from the last point to the first point. |

##### Example

```
<Canvas
	width={300}
	height={300}
>
	<Shape
		x={40}
		y={0}
		points={[
			{ x: 10, y: 10},
			{ x: 100, y: 10 },
			{ x: 10, y: 100}
		]}
		color="#f00"
		fill={true}
	/>
</Canvas>
```

### Text

Draws text to the screen at the given coordinates.

##### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| x  | The origin x coord of the text |
| y   | The origin y coord of the text |
| color | the color for the text (default black) |
| font | the font for the text (default 12px Arial) |

##### Children

Accepts a single child, which is the text to be displayed

##### Example

```
<Canvas
	width={300}
	height={300}
>
	<Text
		x={5}
		y={60}
	>
		Some text here
	</Text>
	<Text
		x={5}
		y={80}
		color="#00f"
		font="18px Times New Roman"
	>
		Blue Text
	</Text>
</Canvas>
```

### Image

The Image element takes care of loading and displaying an image asset to the canvas.

Images are cached after first load, so re-using the same src will not cause the image to be loaded a second time.

##### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| x  | The origin x coord to draw the image at |
| y   | The origin y coord to draw the image at |
| src | The URL that the image can be found at. This can also be base-64 encoded image data |
| width | The width to draw the image at |
| height | The height to draw the image at |
| clip | See Image Clipping below |
| rot | Rotation angle in degrees |
| flipX | Boolean, indicates if the image should be flipped on the X axis |
| flipY | Boolean, indicates if the image should be flipped on the Y axis |
| onLoad | Function that is called when the image loads. If the image is already loaded, the function will not be called (note, using this function can cause optimization issues) |

##### Example

```
<Canvas
	width={300}
	height={300}
>
	<Image
		src="https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png"
		x={40}
		y={50}
		width={50}
		height={50}
	/>
</Canvas>
```

##### Base64 Encoded Example

```
const imageData = "data:image/png;base64,<some base 64 encoded data here>";
return <Canvas
	width={300}
	height={300}
>
	<Image
		src={imageData}
		x={40}
		y={50}
		width={50}
		height={50}
	/>
</Canvas>;
```

##### Image Clipping

The clip parameter allows drawing of only part of the image. It takes in the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| x  | X coord of where to start the clip |
| y   | Y coord of where to start the clip |
| width | The width of the clip |
| height | The height of the clip |

Note that these parameters are all translated into image space from draw space. So for example, if I had an image that was 50x50, but I was drawing it like this:

```
	<Image
		src={src}
		x={40}
		y={50}
		width={200}
		height={200}
		clip={{
			x: 100,
			y: 100,
			width: 50,
			height: 50,
		}}
	/>
</Canvas>;
```

The x coordinate is 50% of the final width of the image, meaning that when it is translated, it translates into half of the image width, so it becomes 25. This is to avoid the developer needing to know the size of the image before it's loaded (and becomes important because the Image component does not expose the image data). So when using clip, just use the width and height that you're passing into the Image component to make your calculations about how much to clip.

You can also observe the imageExample in the source to see how this is used.

### Images

The Images element draws multiple images to the screen. This can be helpful when you need to draw a lot of images but don't want to have the overhead of a lot of React components. In general this component behaves exactly like the Image component.

##### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| images | A list containing objects that conform to the parameters for the Image component |
| onLoad | Function that is called when any images load. If all images are already loaded, the function will not be called. The callback function will be given a single param: the src of the image that was loaded. If the same image is listed multiple times in 'images', the callback will be called multiple times for the same src. Like Image, using this can cause slowness. |

##### Example

```
<Canvas
	width={300}
	height={300}
>
	<Images
		images={[
			{
				src:"https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png",
				x:40,
				y:50,
				width:50,
				height:50,
			},
		]}
	/>
</Canvas>
```

### Line

The Line element draws a line of a specific color between two given points.

##### Parameters

| ----------- | ----------- |
| x | The origin x coord of the line |
| y | The origin y coord of the line  |
| x2 | The destination x coord of the line |

| color | A hex color code, which determines the color of the line |

##### Example

```
<Canvas
	width={300}
	height={300}
>
	<Line
		x={40}
		y={0}
		x2={100}
		y2={150}
		color="#f00"
	/>
</Canvas>
```

### Rect

		endAngle={Math.PI}
		color="#f00"
		fill={false}
		sector={false}
	/>
</Canvas>
```

### Raw

Sometimes the basic elements contained in react-canvas aren't enough. For example, if you need to do a very complex shape with semi-circles and lines, currently there's no way to to do that, except creating a custom component with access to the raw canvas context.

That's where the Raw component comes in. It takes in a single prop, which is a callback it will call with the context as the first parameter, allowing you to access any low level functions or complex operations you need to.


##### Parameters

| Parameter    | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| drawFn | A callback that will be called on-render with a single param, which will be the context of the canvas. Note this is not a React context object. but rather an instance of [CanvasRenderingContext2D](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D) |

##### Example

```
<Canvas
	width={300}
	height={300}
>
	<Raw drawFn={(context) => {
		// do any low level canvas code here
	}} />
</Canvas>
```

### Clip

Clip takes in parameters that define a rectangle, and a list of children. It will use the canvas context clip method to ensure that any part of those children that falls outside the rectangle is not drawn. This is different from the clip in Image, which determines the section of the source image to display.

##### Children

Acts as a container, it can handle any ReactCanvas based children.

##### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| x | The start x of the clip rect |
| y | The start y of the clip rect |
| width | The width of the clip rect |
| height | The height of the clip rect |

##### Example

```
<Canvas
	width={300}
	height={300}
>
	<Clip
		x={100}
		y={100}
		width={100}
		height={100}
	>
		<Text
			x={150}
			y={130}
		>
			Clipped text
		</Text>
    </Clip>
</Canvas>
```

### Pattern

The Pattern element allows drawing an image in a repeated pattern in a rectangle.

##### Parameters

| Parameter    | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| x | X position to start the draw at |
| y | Y position to start the draw at |
| width | Width of the rectangle |
| height | Height of the rectangle |
| src | Similar to image, a url, or raw image data to tile |

##### Example

```
<Canvas
	width={300}
	height={300}
>
	<Pattern
        x={100}
        y={100}
        width={200}
        height={200}
        src="https://website.com/path/to/image"
    />
</Canvas>
```

### CompoundElement

The `CompoundElement` is an attempt to improve rendering when there are a lot of objects on the screen. What it does is detect any time its children change. When this happens, it pre-renders its entire child list (using `renderToCanvas`) and then draws that rendered image moving forward. It can be given an x and y offset to move the drawn image around the screen. This component is very useful when you have a lot of objects all moving in the same direction that don't change very often (such as a background layer of a map).

Note that this component auto-detects the dimensions of its content. This requires two passes with the render which can be expensive. This also does not correctly handle every possible draw operation, and should be considered experimental.

Lastely, this component is not well named and the name may change in the future.
##### Children

Takes multiple children, must be ReactCanvas elements.

##### Parameters

| Parameter    | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| xOff | X position to offset the image draw at. Optional (defaults 0) |
| yOff | Y position to offset the image draw at. Optional (defaults 0) |
| extraData | Any extra data that gets passed into renderToCanvas. Use this when you need to pass context data to children. Note that any change to extraData _will_ cause the element to re-render |
| zoom | Current zoom level for the element. Optional (defaults 1) |
| maxZoom | The highest zoom level your component can go. Optional (defaults 1) |
| zoomAffectOffset | If true, offsets will also be affected by zoom level (defaults false) |
| noZoomPosition | If true, position will not be affected by zoom level (defaults false) |
| zoomXOff | X Offset to not zoom (see zoom below) |
| zoomYOff | Y Offset to not zoom (see zoom below) |

##### Zoom

Zooming in and out of a component can be confused to not cause a re-render, similar to how the offset works. In the case of zooming, both `zoom` and `maxZoom` are treated such that a value of `1` is 100%, normal zoom level.

If you change the `zoom` parameter, the `CompoundElement` will not re-render its children, but rather will draw the pre-rendered image larger or smaller, as appropriate.

Because stretching images/text/etc tends to pixelate them, the `maxZoom` property can be used. When the `maxZoom` property is given, the resulting components are treated as if they were rendered at that level. This then allows the `CompoundElement` to only shrink the resulting image, and never expand it, which can improve pixelation.

Text does not perform well with small zoom levels.

*Important:* When using `maxZoom`, render all children of the CompoundElement as if that zoom was in effect. IE if a `Rect` is normally from (50,50) to (100,100), and your `maxZoom` is 2, render it from (100,100) to (200,200). The `CompoundElement` will take care of ensuring it draws the correct size.

Sometimes it becomes important to only zoom a portion of the image. For example, let's say you have a frame starting at (100, 100), and a rectangle at (125, 125) inside that frame. If you only want to zoom what is inside that frame, you don't want to have the zoom apply to the entire 125 of the rectangle's position, as that could cause it to move more than expected. That is what `zoomXOff` and `zoomYOff` are for. In this case you would set them to the coordinates of the frame, and only the last 25 of the rectangle would be subject to the zoom.

##### Example

```
<Canvas
	width={300}
	height={300}
>
	<CompoundElement
		width={400}
		height={400}
	>
		{images.map((image, index) => {
			return <Image key={index} src={sampleImage} x={image.x} y={image.y} width={50} height={50} />
		})}
	</CompoundElement>
</Canvas>
```

### ImageStrip

The `ImageStrip` component is meant to be able to display certain portions of a sprite-sheet, one frame at a time.

##### Parameters

| Parameter    | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| src | The image to use as the spritesheet |
| x | The x coord of where to draw on the canvas |
| y | The y coord of where to draw on the canvas |
| width | How wide the resulting image should be on the canvas |
| height | How tall the resulting image shoudl be on the canvas |
| cellX | The x coord of the sprite on the spritesheet to draw |
| cellY | The y coord of the sprite on the spritesheet to draw |
| cellWidth | How wide each sprite in the sheet is |
| cellHeight | How tall each sprite in the sheet is |

##### Example

This example renders the second sprite of the sheet, assuming a sheet with 75x75 px sprites. It renders the image at 100x100 at 50x50 resolution.

```
<Canvas
	width={300}
	height={300}
>
	<ImageStrip
		src={sampleImage}
		x={100}
		y={100}
		width={50}
		height={50}
		cellX={1}
		cellY={0}
		cellWidth={75}
		cellHeight={75}
	/>
</Canvas>
```

### Animate

The `Animate` is meant to be able to automatically display the correct frame of a spritesheet, based on a global frame ticker.

The Animate component must be wrapped in an `AnimationProvider` to function.

##### Parameters

The following parameters are required but are the same as `ImageStripe` above:
src, x, y, width, height, cellWidth, cellHeight

| Parameter    | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| startX | The starting cellX on the sprite sheet |
| startY | The starting cellY on the sprit sheet |
| frameCount | The total number of frames in the animation |
| rowWidth | The number of spritesheet frames per row |

##### Example

This example renders the animation

```
<Canvas
	width={300}
	height={300}
>
	<Animate
		src={sampleImage}
		x={100}
		y={100}
		width={50}
		height={50}
		startX={1}
		startY={0}
		cellWidth={75}
		cellHeight={75}
		frameCount={20}
		rowWidth={5}
	/>
</Canvas>
```

### AnimationContext/AnimationProvider

The `AnimationContext` provides a way for the animation system to sychronize the animations as well as for your application to advance them.

The following values are exported by the context

| Value    | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| frame | The current animation frame. This continuously increases. |
| tick | This is a function. Call this function when you want the animation frames to move forward |

##### Example

```
import React, { useContext, useEffect } from 'react';
import { AnimationContext } from '@bucky24/react-canvas';

import SampleImage from '../assets/sampleSpriteSheet.png';

export default function App() {
	const { tick } = useContext(AnimationContext);

	useEffect(() => {
		const interval = setInterval(tick, 100);

		return () => {
			clearInterval(interval);
		}
	});

	return <Canvas width={300} height={300}>
		<Animate
			src={SampleImage}
			x={100}
			y={100}
			width={50}
			height={50}
			startX={1}
			startY={0}
			cellWidth={75}
			cellHeight={75}
			frameCount={20}
			rowWidth={5}
		/>
	</Canvas>;
}
```

## Events

### Event List

The following events are available on the Canvas:

| Event | Params |
|---|---|
| onMouseMove | Coords |
| onMouseDown | CoordsWithButton |
| onMouseUp | CoordsWithButton |
| onKeyDown | KeyData |
| onKeyUp | KeyData |
| onWheel | CoordsWithDirection |

#### Coords

Coords is simply an object containing x and y as integers.

#### CoordsWithButton

CoordsWithButton contains x and y coordinates, as well as a `button` field that is one of the following:

| Type |
| -- |
| ButtonTypes.LEFT |
| ButtonTypes.MIDDLE |
| ButtonTypes.RIGHT |

#### KeyData

KeyData is an object containing `char` which is the character of the key pressed, and `code` which is the key code.

#### CoordsWithDirection

CoordsWithDirection contains x and y coordinates, as well as an `up` field, which indicates if the scroll wheel was moved up (true) or down (false)

### Handling on the Canvas

The quickest way to handle canvas events is via event handlers directly on the Canvas object. Any component containing a Canvas can listen for any events it emits via callbacks.

```
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
	constructor(props) {
		super(props);
	}
	render() {
		return (<div className={styles.appRoot}>
			<Canvas
				width={300}
				height={300}
				onMove={({ x, y, button }) => {
					console.log("mouse moved to", data.x, data.y);
				}}
				onMouseDown={({ x, y, button }) => {
				
				}}
				onMouseUp={({ x, y, button }) => {
				
				}}
			>
				{ /* some things here */ }
			</Canvas>
		</div>);
	}
};
```
### CanvasComponent

If your components extend `CanvasComponent` (see below sections), you can handle events as native functions inside the component as React lifecycle methods.

If `bounds` is set on the child object (containing x, y, width, and height), the second parameter of the callback for all mouse events will be a boolean indicating if the operation took place within those bounds. If no bounds are set, then this boolean is always false.

Note that if you make a component a CanvasComponent but it is not nested inside a Canvas element, it will throw an error to your console because the child context doesn't exist.

Another thing of note: CanvasComponent consumes `componentDidMount` to do event handling. If you are using `componentDidMount` in your custom component, be sure to call `super.componentDidMount()` or else event handling will not work.

##### Example

```
import React from 'react';
import { CanvasComponent } from 'react-canvas';

class MyElement extends CanvasComponent {
	constructor(props) {
		super(props);
		
		this.bounds = {
			x: 100,
			y: 100,
			width: 20,
			height: 20
		};
	}
	onMouseMove({ x, y }, overMe) {
		// take some action
	}
	onMouseDown({ x, y, button }, overMe) {
		// take some action
	}
	onMouseUp({ x, y, button }, overMe) {
		// take some action
	}
	onKeyDown({ char, code }) {
		// do something
	}
	onKeyUp({ char, code }) {
		// do something
	}
	onWheel({ x, y, up }, overMe) {
		// take action
	}
	render() {
		// some rendering here
	}
}

export default MyElement;
```

### Raw Event Handling

It is possible to hook into canvas events for your component by using the `registerListener` and `unregisterListener` functions on the Canvas context.

Both `registerListener` and `unregisterListener` take in two parameters: an EventType, and a closure that will be passed a data object when the event is triggered.

It is recommended that your component call `registerListener` only once, and that you call `unregisterListener` when the component is about to unmount, similar to any other listeners in react.

| Event Type | Triggered by | Contents of Data |
| -- | -- | -- |
| EventTypes.MOVE | The mouse moving across the canvas | An object containing x and y of the mouse on the canvas. May also contain a "touches" key if on a multi-touch device, which contains the x and y of all touches detected | 
| EventTypes.MOUSE_UP | The mouse being released | An object containing x and y of the mouse on the canvas and a button corresponding to a ButtonType above |
| EventTypes.MOUSE_DOWN| The mouse being pressed | An object containing x and y of the mouse on the canvas and a button corresponding to a ButtonType above |
| EventTypes.KEY_DOWN | A key being pressed or repeated | An object containing the char value of the key and the key code |
| EventTypes.KEY_UP | A key being released | An object containing the char value of the key and the key code |
| EventTypes.WHEEL | The scroll wheel being spun | An object containing x and y of the mouse on the canvas, and a boolean "up" which indicates if the wheel is spinning up or down |

## Extending

You can easily create your own elements that have access to the canvas context.

### Context

The following properties are available from the CanvasContext:

| Name | Purpose |
| ---- | --- |
| context | The raw canvas context. It is not recommend that you use this, see `useWithContext` below. |
| registerListener | Function for event handling. See above for usage |
| unregisterListener | Function for event handling. See above for usage |
| loadImage | Function that takes in a src and a cb function. If the image is already loaded, it will return the img object. If not, the cb function is called when the image is loaded |
| loadPattern | Function that takes in a src and a cb function. If the pattern is already loaded, it will return the canvas pattern object. If not, the cb function is called when the pattern is loaded |
| forceRenderCount | This is the number of times the forceRerender function has been called. This can be used to determine if a render is taking place because an image has loaded (as image loads call forceRerender by default) |
| width | The width of the Canvas |
| height | The height of the Canvas |
| is3d | Boolean, indicate if the Canvas was configured for webgl |
| forceRerender | Forces the entire canvas to re-render |

##### Example

```
import React, { useContext } from 'react';
import { CanvasContext } from 'react-canvas';

const MyElement = (props) => {
    const { context } = useContext(CanvasContext);
			
    if (!context) {
		return null;
	}
	context.save();

	// do context things here

	context.restore();
}

export default MyElement;

```

##### Rerendering

The canvas context also provides a function `forceRerender` which will essentially call `this.forceUpdate()` on the top level canvas. This can be useful in some situations to force the canvas to redraw.

## renderToImage

React Canvas exports a method, `renderToImage`, that can take in a series of React Canvas components, and a width and height, then return a data string that represents the image that would be the result of those components being rendered to a canvas.

`renderToImage` does not need to be called from inside a component's render method.

`context` is not a required parameter, but it is recommended to pass in the context of the parent Canvas if possible. If you are trying to get the context from a top level component that exports the Canvas element, you can use a ref to the Canvas and call `getMyContext` to get the context object.

```
import React from 'react';
import {
    Line,
    renderToImage,
} from 'react-canvas';

const App() {
    const width = 300;
    const height = 100;

	const components = <>
		<Line
			x={10}
			y={10}
			x2={100}
			y2={10}
			color="#888"
		/>
		<Line
			x={10}
			y={10}
			x2={10}
			y2={100}
			color="#888"
		/>
	</>;

	const imageSource = renderToImage(components, width, height);

	return (<div>
		<img src={imageSource}>
	</div>);
};

export default App;
```

## renderToCanvas

React Canvas exports a method, `renderToCanvas`, that does basically the same thing as `renderToImage` (and takes the same parameters), but instead of a base-64 data string, returns a canvas dom element that has had the given elements rendered to it. This is useful if you have images that are loaded from outside of your domain, as the browser will not allow these to be rendered to an image, but it will allow them to be rendered to a canvas.

The method returns an object containing the following properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
| -- | -- | -- |
| canvas | canvas | The canvas object |
| dims | Rect | Contains x, y, width, and height |

This canvas can be passed into the `src` attribute of an Image element to render it.

This method does take the following additional properties:

| Property | Type | Description |
| -- | -- | -- |
| extraData | mixed | Used in case of a need to pass any sort of context data to rendered components. renderToCanvas breaks context chains. Any data passed in this method will be available in the RenderContext |

## blendImage

The `blendImage` function allows an existing image to be manipulated on the fly, generating a new image (as a Canvas) that can be drawn.

### Parameters

| Name | Description
| -- | -- |
| src | The source (url or base64 string) to blend |
| operations | An array of BlendOperations. If empty, the original src is returned |

### Usage

```
blendImage(sampleImage, [
    {
        type: BLEND_TYPE.COLOR_SWAP,
        from: '#ffffff',
        to: '#0000ff',
    },
    {
        type: BLEND_TYPE.COLOR_SWAP,
        from: '#000000',
        to: '#00ff00',
    },
]).then((newImg) => {
    // newImg is a Canvas containing the rendered image, and can now be stored for drawing.
});
```

### BlendOperation

Represents an operation that can be performed on an image

| Name | Type | Description
| -- | -- | -- |
| type | BLEND_TYPE | Describes what operation to perform |
| * | * | Other params determined by BLEND_TYPE, see below |

### BLEND_TYPE

#### COLOR_SWAP

`BLEND_TYPE.COLOR_SWAP` allows swapping one color in an image completely for another color. It expects the following parameers on the `BlendOperation`:

| Name | Type | Description
| -- | -- | -- |
| from | Hex Color | A string containing the RGB hex code to look for |
| to | Hex Color | A stirng containing the RGB hex code to use as a replacement

## useWithContext

The `useWithContext` hook is the safest way to actually access the raw canvas context. This is because it takes into account any `Clip` elements that your component might be inside. It also protects against the context being null, so you don't have to worry about checking that in your components. It also handles the appropriate return value so that React doesn't complain about your component returning nothing.

### Usage:

```
const React from 'react';
const { useWithContext } from '@bucky24/react-canvas';

export default function MyComponent() {
	const withContext = useWithContext();

	return withContext((context) => {
		// the context is now safe to use for raw drawing even if you're inside a clip region.
	});
}
